# **Speckle Comments 💬 to Notion📄**

- About this app🔽
    
    This app sends your Speckle comments into a given Notion database and assigns Speckle attributes as properties of Notion pages. Our main aim was to create a bidirectional link between two applications so we can leverage the best out of both. Take a look 👀
    

****Inspiration 🌹****

Recently added **Comments** feature on Speckle has broken new grounds but since it's still being developed, it has its own limitations. One limitation we saw was assigning statuses to comments and tracking of them. We thought, "*Notion is really flexible and powerful in this area, and its used by a lot of architecture offices, maybe we can track their status there. Why not integrate the two?*".

With this app, you send your Speckle comments to Notion and track their status there. Once its status is "Archived" in Notion, it'll be archived in Speckle as well.

****What does it do? 😏****

It takes comments from an existing Speckle stream🌊 and sends it to Notion with the properties:

- `Comment ID 🆔`
- `Author ✍`
- `Camera Position 📹`
- `Created At 📅`

It sets the page cover as the `Screenshot 📷` of comment

And it also creates an iframe with a `Speckle Viewer 👁‍🗨` embedded.

Finally assigns status `Not Started 🔴`

In **Notion** you can track and update the comment and when the comments is R esolved and **Archived 📦** in Notion, it will also be archived in Speckle🔹.
