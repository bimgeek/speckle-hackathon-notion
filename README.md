# **Speckle Comments 💬 to Notion📄**

- About this app🔽
    
    This app sends your Speckle comments into a given Notion database and assigns Speckle attributes as properties of Notion pages. Our main aim was to create a bidirectional link between two applications so we can leverage the best out of both. Take a look 👀
    

****Inspiration 🌹****

Recently added **Comments** feature on Speckle has broken new grounds but since it's still being developed, it has its own limitations. One limitation we saw was assigning statuses to comments and tracking of them. We thought, "*Notion is really flexible and powerful in this area, and its used by a lot of architecture offices, maybe we can track their status there. Why not integrate the two?*".

With this app, you send your Speckle comments to Notion and track their status there. Once its status is "Archived" in Notion, it'll be archived in Speckle as well.

****What does it do? 😏****

It takes comments from an existing Speckle stream🌊 and sends it to Notion with the properties:

- `Comment ID 🆔`
- `Author ✍`
- `Camera Position 📹`
- `Created At 📅`

It sets the page cover as the `Screenshot 📷` of comment

And it also creates an iframe with a `Speckle Viewer 👁‍🗨` embedded.

Finally assigns status `Not Started 🔴`

In **Notion** you can track and update the comment and when the comments is R esolved and **Archived 📦** in Notion, it will also be archived in Speckle🔹.

****How to use🤔****
- Create a Speckle account (if you don't have one already) and get a new Access Token. Be sure to include scopes for `streams:read`, `streams:write`, `profile:read`, `users:read`.
- Create a Notion account and get a secret token. You can use this [database](https://mbgoker.notion.site/mbgoker/26d224183bfc488181a37cd2d74be1bf?v=82cab8b3adbc4589a033c7065f392c80) for testing.
- Clone the git repo and install the required libraries. See requirements.txt.
- Start a terminal in the app folder run the command `streamlit run main.py` A browser with the Streamlit UI should open.
- On the App page fill in your Speckle token and Notion Token. If using your own Notion database fill in it's database ID.
- Select one of your Speckle streams from the list which has comments.
- Click the Run button. The app will then gather the data and send to Speckle. (The first run takes a while but afterwards it runs quickly)
- In Notion you should now see your comments with included properties, screenshot, and embedded Speckle viewer.
